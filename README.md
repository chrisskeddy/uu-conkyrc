# uu-conkyrc
~/.conkyrc for use with conky
This is just a conkyrc used with conky.

install conky
  -Ubuntu/Linux Mint
    sudo apt-get install conky-all

Conky is a small usage program that can display system usage on the desktop. Conky can also be used to pull other
information from commands. I run the weather command once every hour which outputs to a file which conky reads.

#For weather
install weather-util
  -Ubuntu/Linux Mint
    sudo apt-get install weather-util weather-util-data
