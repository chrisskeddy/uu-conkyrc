Conky is a small usage program that can display system usage on the desktop. Conky can also be used to pull other
information from commands. I run the weather command once every hour which outputs to a file which conky reads.

#weather

install weather-util

  <code>sudo apt-get install weather-util weather-util-data</code>
#install
